# High-level Project Overview
## Describing and Showcasing Current Programming Projects

### Introduction
31-01-2023: 69 days left before the exam period starts. 
The aim is to have several programming projects as exam candidates and a well-documented TSPA2 that can function without me for a long time after leaving DTU Sustain. Having production-ready programming projects is an advantage when searching for a job.

The main reasons for creating these projects are:
1. To have a reference code reference in my CV
2. To have a project for the exam period

### Projects
- Victor's Web Framework: A streamlined solution for building web applications
- Webshop: victors bog vezit.net
- TSPA2: A scripting app that automates tasks when a new PC is PXE installed
- Artek
- Lyngby Frisbee Klub, membership and subscription portal (lfk.vezit.net)
- Inform (out-of-service): A Python script that checks if a PC is out of service
- Equip-Online: An application that tracks all computers and their owners, notifying by email if a PC is out of warranty.

### Introduction
This paper is written 31-01-2023 Victor (me) has 69 days left before examperiod starts. I am determined to have several programming-projects as candidates for my exam period, as well as having made a well documented TSPA2, that can function without me for a long time after I am no longer at DTU Sustain. Having made programming projects that is in production is an advantige as a programmer, when you are searching for a new job. Because your projects will be a frame of reference of what you can do as a programmer, and employers can easierly determine if your skillset is relevant for them. Therefore I am determined to make some applikations before my school period starts. This is for two main reaseons:
1. To have a frame of reference for future employer
2. To have a project for my examsperiod
