Release a version 1.0.0 of Finish making a version 
In order for you to make any application that can be sustainable, you need to release a version of the webframework, that your projects can rely on. Use the released version to rebuild the webshop. This means that it should be explicitly stated in the webshop project, that it is build on top of victorswebframework v1.0.0, also note version of php, apache, composer-dependencies and other relevant technology. So that it is more easily to rebuild the webshop. Make a reference to a docker image/project/git-repo that your project can run on. Once you have made and understood how to proceed with this, then you can proceed to do the same with one of your other projects that relies on the victorswebframework, maybe it is a good time to patch, and make updates to victorswebframework, before taking to use in another project.

###  1. Build and release a production version of victorsframework that other projects can depend on.

Build another project (the webshop), and note down all relevant versioning, and safe all depencies in composer that the project depends on. victorsframework should not have any dependencies in composer. This means that the vendor folder should be empty.

### 2. When you have succesfully build the webshop project on top of victorswebframework
When you have succesfully build the webshop project on top of victorswebframework. You should go back to victorswebframework and patch or upgrade if nessesary (comments in the code is important for documentation). After that you should proceed to the next project. Which should be TSPA2. Before you begin coding TSPA2, you should make a usecase & requirement specification. Defining what is the need and usage for this application. This will make it clear what it's purpose is, and what is nessesary in regards to coding the application. Then you should deploy the application in a docker container which image is safed, as well dockerbuild files, is put in a git repository safed in githubb. Once the application is up and running then 

* domain name tspa2.sustain.dtu.dk
* make a folder in the TSPA2 git repo that holds powershell scripts and docs for connecting to active directory. This is needed for user validation as well as determing the OU location for a computer.
* make a folder for the application that needs to run inside the SCCM
* make a release and deploy it.

### 3. When you have build and deployed TSPA2, you will proceed to make a usecase & requirement specification for Equip-Online.
