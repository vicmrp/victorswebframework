##Project goals: 
Victor's Web Framework is designed to provide a structured and organized solution for building web applications. The client-side of the framework is based on a page-based approach, where each page of the application is contained within its own folder. This helps to achieve the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, particularly for elements like the header and footer of the website.

By having a centralized location for the header and footer, developers can make changes to these common elements in one place, without the need to update each individual page. This streamlines the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors.

The page-based approach in Victor's Web Framework is intended to make it easier for developers to manage their code base and focus on delivering a great user experience. The framework provides a simple, yet powerful solution for building web applications without sacrificing ease-of-use.
