# Project title
Victor's Web Framework: A Streamlined Solution for Building Web Applications

# Description

## Project goals: 
Victor's Web Framework is designed to provide a structured and organized solution for building web applications. The client-side of the framework is based on a page-based approach, where each page of the application is contained within its own folder. This helps to achieve the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, particularly for elements like the header and footer of the website.

By having a centralized location for the header and footer, developers can make changes to these common elements in one place, without the need to update each individual page. This streamlines the development process and reduces the likelihood of errors.

The page-based approach in Victor's Web Framework is intended to make it easier for developers to manage their code base and focus on delivering a great user experience. The framework provides a simple, yet powerful solution for building web applications without sacrificing ease-of-use.


## Key features:
Page-based structure: A page-based approach for client-side code, with each page contained within its own folder, allowing for the DRY principle to be achieved.

Service repository pattern: The framework implements a service repository pattern to separate abstraction layers, making it easier to perform unit testing.

Server-side unit testing: Support for unit testing on the server side using PHPUnit.

Reusable code: A centralized location for common elements like the header and footer, reducing the likelihood of errors and streamlining the development process.

Easy-to-use: A simple, yet powerful solution for building web applications without sacrificing ease-of-use.

Scalable: The framework is designed to be scalable, allowing developers to build applications of varying size and complexity.

Well-documented: Clear and concise documentation to help developers understand and use the framework effectively


## The target audience for Victor's Web Framework is:

Individual developers: Designed to meet the needs of a single developer looking for a streamlined and organized solution for building web applications.

Small teams: Suitable for small teams of developers working on web applications, as it provides a common foundation for code organization and structure.

Learning enthusiasts: The framework serves as a great learning tool for those interested in building web applications and understanding the underlying structure and patterns.

Organizations: Victor's Web Framework can also be useful for small organizations, who want to build web applications, with a more streamlined, organized and efficient development process.

PHP developers: Specifically targeted towards PHP developers, who want to build web applications, utilizing the server-side capabilities of PHP.

Web application enthusiasts: The framework is ideal for anyone interested in web development and wants to build web applications, leveraging its structure and patterns to streamline their development process."




## Technical Details for Victor's Web Framework:

Server-side: The framework utilizes the power of PHP for server-side scripting and processing.

Client-side: The client-side of the framework is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing a single-page architecture for efficient and organized client-side scripting.

Service Repository Pattern: The framework implements the Service Repository pattern, which helps to separate abstractions and simplify the development process.

Unit Testing: The framework supports unit testing on the server-side using PHPUnit, enabling efficient and automated testing of the application's codebase.

Page-based Structure: The client-side of the framework is designed as a page-based structure, allowing for efficient organization of client-side code and enabling the reuse of common elements such as headers and footers.

Dependency Management: The framework uses Composer for managing dependencies, ensuring that the necessary libraries and packages are installed and updated with ease.

Support for APIs: The framework provides support for building and integrating APIs, allowing for seamless communication between the client-side and server-side of the application.

Code Reusability: The framework's structure and patterns allow for efficient code reuse and organization, enabling the development of applications with a more streamlined and efficient codebase.
